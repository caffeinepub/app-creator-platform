          "description": "Fix the ActorGuard component logic to properly handle initialize() responses. Ensure that when initialize() returns true, false, or throws errors containing 'already initialized' or 'Unauthorized', the component treats these as ready states and allows the app to render. Add proper error handling to distinguish between temporary loading states and genuine backend unavailability. Implement a timeout mechanism to show an error state if the backend doesn't respond within a reasonable time (e.g., 30 seconds). Update the loading state management to correctly transition from loading to ready once the actor is available and initialization completes successfully."
