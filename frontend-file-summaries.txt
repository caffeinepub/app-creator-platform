  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "All React Query hooks with SessionExpiredError and parseError helper; useGetCallerUserProfile returns custom isLoading/isFetched states that account for actor availability, preventing premature ProfileSetup display.",
  "frontend/src/services/llmService.ts": "LLM service with OpenRouter API integration; system prompt now includes explicit AUDIO RULES instructing the AI to never use `<audio>` tags or `new Audio()` with file paths, never call `alert()` for errors, and always use the Web Audio API (with a concrete example) for all sound needs.",

  "frontend/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx": "Full chat interface with message history, live preview/code tabs, API key management, and alarm integration; fixes the TypeScript error by removing the non-existent `onAudioPromptNeeded` prop from the `AlarmNotification` usage, keeping only the valid `message` and `onDismiss` props.",

  "frontend/src/hooks/useAlarmSound.ts": "Custom React hook managing a Web Audio API alarm sound system; all AudioContext operations (resume, createOscillator, createGain, start) are now wrapped in try-catch blocks that log warnings silently instead of throwing, and `playAlarm` attempts to resume a suspended context before returning `needsUserGesture: true`.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useAudioContextInit.ts": "App-level hook that attaches passive event listeners (click, keydown, pointerdown, touchstart) to the document and creates/resumes the shared AudioContext on the first user interaction, ensuring audio is unlocked before any alarm fires.",

Fixed `createDistortionCurve` to explicitly use `new ArrayBuffer` so the return type is `Float32Array<ArrayBuffer>`, resolving the TypeScript strict-type error on `WaveShaperNode.curve`."
