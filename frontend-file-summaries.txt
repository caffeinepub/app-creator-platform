  "frontend/index.css": "Global dark theme CSS with OKLCH color tokens for Noventra.Ai's near-black background, indigo/cyan palette, Space Grotesk/Inter/JetBrains Mono fonts, glassmorphism utilities, glow effects, and animation keyframes.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind config with Noventra.Ai custom color tokens (surface levels, indigo, cyan), font families (Space Grotesk, Inter, JetBrains Mono), glow box shadows, and animation utilities.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root app component using TanStack Router with routes for Home (/), Sessions (/sessions), New Session (/sessions/new), and Chat (/sessions/:sessionId/chat), plus a Sonner Toaster.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for all backend operations (getSessions, getSession, createSession, deleteSession, addMessage, updateFiles) with proper cache invalidation; useCreateSession now checks both actor existence and isFetching state before calling the backend, with improved error propagation.",
  "frontend/src/services/llmService.ts": "Template-based code generation service with fixed `generateAIResponse` that normalizes project type strings (handles \"Landing Page\", \"landing\", \"Full-Stack App\", \"Mobile App\", etc.) and routes to the correct scaffold builder; `buildLandingPageScaffold` now returns a complete, self-contained HTML landing page with Hero, Features, How It Works, Project Types, and CTA sections using Noventra.Ai's dark theme; `extractFilesFromResponse` supports both `filename=` and `filepath=` annotations with a generic fallback.",
  "frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx": "Noventra.Ai landing page with hero, features grid, stats, and CTA — all animations replaced with CSS keyframes (`fade-up`, `fade-in`, `glow-pulse`) and `useEffect`-based mount transitions instead of framer-motion.",

  "frontend/src/pages/NewSessionPage.tsx": "Session creation form with project name input and four project type selector cards; now imports useActor to track actor readiness, disables the submit button while the actor is loading, shows a \"Connecting…\" indicator, and surfaces the actual error message from failed mutations instead of a generic toast.",

  "frontend/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx": "Full chat interface with session loading, optimistic message updates typed as `'user' | 'assistant'`, LLM integration via `generateAIResponse`, file extraction, error handling, and download-all functionality; fixes the TypeScript error by normalizing `msg.role` from `string` to `'user' | 'assistant'` before passing to `MessageBubble`.",
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global dark theme CSS for Noventra.Ai placed at the correct path (`src/index.css`) where `main.tsx` imports it from — contains OKLCH color tokens, Space Grotesk/Inter/JetBrains Mono font imports, glassmorphism utilities, button components, and keyframe animations."
