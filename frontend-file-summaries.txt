  "frontend/index.css": "Global dark theme CSS with OKLCH color tokens for Noventra.Ai's near-black background, indigo/cyan palette, Space Grotesk/Inter/JetBrains Mono fonts, glassmorphism utilities, glow effects, and animation keyframes.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind config with Noventra.Ai custom color tokens (surface levels, indigo, cyan), font families (Space Grotesk, Inter, JetBrains Mono), glow box shadows, and animation utilities.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Root app component using TanStack Router with routes for Home (/), Sessions (/sessions), New Session (/sessions/new), and Chat (/sessions/:sessionId/chat), plus a Sonner Toaster.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query hooks for all backend operations (getSessions, getSession, createSession, deleteSession, addMessage, updateFiles) with proper cache invalidation; useCreateSession now checks both actor existence and isFetching state before calling the backend, with improved error propagation.",
  "frontend/src/services/llmService.ts": "Template-based code generation service returning multi-file starter scaffolds for four project types (fullstack, landing, mobile, custom); all localhost URL references (localhost:5173, localhost:4000) removed from Getting Started instructions and replaced with generic \"run the development server and open the application in your browser\" guidance.",
  "frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx": "Noventra.Ai landing page with hero, features grid, stats, and CTA — all animations replaced with CSS keyframes (`fade-up`, `fade-in`, `glow-pulse`) and `useEffect`-based mount transitions instead of framer-motion.",

  "frontend/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx": "Full chat interface with session loading, optimistic message updates, LLM integration via `generateAIResponse`, file extraction via `extractFilesFromResponse` (array-based), and download-all functionality; fixes import name (`generateAIResponse`), corrects call signature, and properly converts the extracted files array to a `Record<string, string>` map before updating local state.",
  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global dark theme CSS for Noventra.Ai placed at the correct path (`src/index.css`) where `main.tsx` imports it from — contains OKLCH color tokens, Space Grotesk/Inter/JetBrains Mono font imports, glassmorphism utilities, button components, and keyframe animations."
