  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive fix for the 'actor not available to start' error. An ActorGuard component wraps the entire app, all queries have actor-readiness guards, the backend exposes an initialize() endpoint, and error/loading states are surfaced to users. All four acceptance criteria for REQ-1 appear to be addressed.",

      "description": "Backend system initialization flow with isReady flag and initialize() function that gates all backend calls behind a readiness check",
      "reason": "The build request constraint explicitly states 'Do not change the backend actor interface or data schema'. The diff adds a new isReady state variable, an ensureReady() function called in every backend method, and a new public initialize() endpoint to main.mo, all of which modify the backend actor interface.",
