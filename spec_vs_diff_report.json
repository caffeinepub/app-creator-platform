  "summary": "The diff implements a comprehensive rebuild of the Noventra.Ai landing page generator. All major requirements from REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear to be addressed: session management (create, list, delete), chat interface with code block rendering, AI-generated landing page scaffolds, live preview, backend persistence with owner-based access control, and the full dark theme design system with OKLCH tokens, glassmorphism, glow effects, and the required typography. No significant missing requirements or hallucinated features were identified.",
