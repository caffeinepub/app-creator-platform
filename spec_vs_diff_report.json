  "summary": "The diff addresses all three requirements: REQ-11 (session creation fix via useQueries.ts and NewSessionPage.tsx), REQ-12 (localhost removal from llmService.ts), and REQ-13 (HomePage.tsx navigation links). Evidence from file summaries and modified files confirms most changes are present, but REQ-13 lacks direct content evidence in the diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Fix the navigation link on the Home landing page (HomePage.tsx) that redirects users to the Sessions page. The link must use the React Router path (/sessions) and must not contain any hardcoded localhost or absolute URL.",
      "reason": "The diff does not include a content diff for HomePage.tsx. The file-summary entry for HomePage.tsx only mentions animation changes (framer-motion removal) with no mention of fixing navigation links or CTA buttons routing to /sessions or /sessions/new. There is no evidence in the diff that HomePage.tsx navigation links were corrected.",
