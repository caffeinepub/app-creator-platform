  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 and REQ-2. The llmService.ts now includes a buildLandingPageScaffold function that returns a complete HTML landing page with Hero, Features, How It Works, and CTA sections using Noventra.Ai's dark theme (Space Grotesk font, dark color tokens, glassmorphism). ChatPage.tsx is updated to call generateAIResponse with the project type and includes fallback handling to prevent blank responses. The file summary confirms normalized project type routing and extractFilesFromResponse improvements.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Styles reference the existing dark theme OKLCH color tokens",
      "reason": "The generated scaffold in llmService.ts uses hex/rgba color values (e.g., #030712, rgba(99,102,241,0.35)) rather than OKLCH color tokens as specified. The existing global CSS uses OKLCH tokens, but the scaffold does not reference them.",
