  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 (ActorGuard optimization with 8s hard timeout, status messages, progress dots) and REQ-3 (SessionErrorBanner with friendly messages, Retry and Logout buttons). REQ-2 (backend main.mo optimization) is partially addressed — the initialize() function appears to have been removed/refactored but no explicit evidence of performance optimization is visible in the truncated diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Optimize backend initialization in main.mo to ensure the initialize() function returns quickly. Avoid blocking or expensive operations during initialization that could cause the frontend to wait.",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo diff shows the actor structure but no explicit initialize() function optimization is visible in the truncated content. The frontend-file-summaries.txt notes that useInitializeSystem mutation was removed (implying initialize() may have been removed from backend too), but no evidence of actual backend performance optimization such as removing blocking loops or making initialization fast is present in the diff.",
